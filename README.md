### 🚀 **Objective**

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

### 🏆 **Project Goals**

1.  **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2.  **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3.  **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4.  **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5.  **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6.  **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

### **Database Design**
